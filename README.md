# Hello-World
Just My First Repository

Hello,
My name is Khamrn. I am looking to learn and develop my skills first in C# as that holds the most practical use in my current role. Once this has some momentum to it however I expect that my hunger for knowledge will drive me to new ideas/skills/projects. 

I am an owl, I am loud at night and like to think and ponder... unless I'm hungry, then I will go and hunt food... and coffee... 

Genuinely hope you are well and happy. 

Khamrn
